# pyzmq-auth-hello-world
Simple PyZMQ Authorization (CurveZMQ) Example

Setup your environment
```
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you can run the example:
```
python simple.py
```
This is designed to just be a very simple Hello World program using PyZMQ curve/security. It can get much more complex.

I would also recommend this [article](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/se-distributed-apps-zeromq-part2/) which was useful to me.
